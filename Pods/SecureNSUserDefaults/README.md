#SecureNSUserDefaults

NSUserDefaults category for iOS and Mac OS X with additional methods to securely save data using strong AES encryption.

NSUserDefaults is a great way to store simple data in a persistent way. However, information is stored unencrypted and can easily be read by human beings (e.g. with [iExplorer](http://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/)). If you want particular information to be stored in a secure way, making it really hard for users to see the actual content, SecureNSUserDefaults might be what you're looking for.

##Installation
I highly recommend you to use CocoaPods for installing this category.

###CocoaPods

```ruby
pod 'SecureNSUserDefaults', '~> 1.0.1'
```

Import the header file everywhere you want to use SecureNSUserDefaults by placing te following code in the top of your file:

```objective-c
#import <SecureNSUserDefaults/NSUserDefaults+SecureAdditions.h>
```

###Manual
1. Copy the files *NSUserDefaults+SecureAdditions.h* and *NSUserDefaults+SecureAdditions.h* into your project;
2. Install [CocoaSecurity](https://github.com/kelp404/CocoaSecurity);
3. Import *NSUserDefaults+SecureAdditions.h* everywhere you need it.

##Usage

###Configure secret
Before SecureNSUserDefaults can be used to get/save encrypted data, make sure to set a **secret** secret:

```objective-c
[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setSecret:@"your_secret_goes_here"];
```

Never store the secret somewhere on your file system or in your user preferences but instead put it somewhere static in your code. Preferably use a salt string in combination with something device specific.

###Store information
Storing information is as easy as always. Prefix the normal NSUserDefaults methods with **secret** and your good to go. For example:

```objective-c
[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setSecretObject:@"something_only_you_may_know" forKey:@"the_key"];
```

All available methods:
```objective-c
- (void)setSecretBool:(BOOL)value forKey:(NSString *)defaultName;
- (void)setSecretFloat:(float)value forKey:(NSString *)defaultName;
- (void)setSecretInteger:(NSInteger)value forKey:(NSString *)defaultName;
- (void)setSecretDouble:(double)value forKey:(NSString *)defaultName;
- (void)setSecretURL:(NSURL *)url forKey:(NSString *)defaultName;
- (void)setSecretObject:(id)value forKey:(NSString *)defaultName;
```

###Getting information
Getting information works in the say way:

```objective-c
[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] secretStringForKey:@"the_key"];
```

All available methods:
```objective-c
- (BOOL)secretBoolForKey:(NSString *)defaultName;
- (NSData*)secretDataForKey:(NSString *)defaultName;
- (NSDictionary*)secretDictionaryForKey:(NSString *)defaultName;
- (float)secretFloatForKey:(NSString *)defaultName;
- (NSInteger)secretIntegerForKey:(NSString *)defaultName;
- (NSArray *)secretStringArrayForKey:(NSString *)defaultName;
- (NSString *)secretStringForKey:(NSString *)defaultName;
- (double)secretDoubleForKey:(NSString *)defaultName;
- (NSURL*)secretURLForKey:(NSString *)defaultName;
- (id)secretObjectForKey:(NSString *)defaultName;
```

Note that if the key does not exist or the data could not be decrypted, either *NO*, *0* or *nil* is returned.

##Tests
The class *SecureNSUserDefaultsTests* contains multiple test cases. Clone the entire Xcode project and run the tests to see if everything still works.
